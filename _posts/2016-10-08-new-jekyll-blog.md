So this is the inaugural post of my new blog/personal homepage.

For now this is a super simple site; it's a bog standard [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
install with the lovely simple [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) theme as a base.

I'm liking Jekyll a lot so far, Markdown's always easy to write & having git
versioning the content of the site feels comfortable & fits in with what I'm used to.
The fact that everything is simple html/sass/js gives a pleasant feeling of being
in control of all aspects of the site (although I guess that means I have only
myself to blame for poor markup and layout).

Having had a look around some other blogs my favourite Jekyll based one I've seen
so far is [@mdo's](http://markdotto.com); the lean, simple look is what I'm trying
to emulate here. Poole is one of @mdo's own themes, so I got a pretty good leg up
from him right from the start!

Thoughts for future things I may add:

* Better homepage/posts list
* Comments system - probably [Disqus](https://disqus.com)
* 'About me' page & header links
